    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>Hello! I am a Cadet at the United States Military Academy, a Computer Science Major with a Cyber Security minor, and member of the Cadet Competitive Cyber Team (<a href="http://www.usma.edu/crc/sitepages/c3t.aspx">C3T</a>). In the future, I look towards
      serving as an infantry officer and eventually transitioning into the US Army Cyber Corps. I greatly enjoy programming and machine exploitation. I also enjoy experimenting with both back-end and front-end development as
      well as writing custom command-line scripts.</p>
